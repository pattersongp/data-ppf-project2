\para{Credit Scores}
One of the earliest applications of data was credit. In the early 19\ts{th}
century, Francis J. Grund immigrated to the United States. Later on, he would
publish \textit{The Americans} (1837) where he describes how credit was easily
rewarded in American society based on the borrower's character and hard work.
This is in opposition to the European system of credit, where credit was
awarded to those who had collateral~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}.

Around the time that Grund was publishing his de Toquevillian analysis of
American credit, there was much debate over the equality of the system.
%many parallels here to today
Many felt that the current credit system based on character, reputation, and
ethic unfairly favored the wealthy, seen in the 1819 and 1837 financial
panics~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}.  It was in the wake of these economic
downturns that the credit system went from a personal and subjective evaluation
system, to a formalized economic system.

In the beginning, letters of recommendation and concensus among neighbors of
those borrowing were collected by those lending. By the 1840's, an American
merchant that did business nationaly was finding that this practice was
unsustainable. This was accutely apparent during the financial crises of the
1830's~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}. Recently bankrupted, Lewis Tappan left the
silk industry, then in 1841 founded the Mercantile Agency. His goal was the
compile detailed information about businesses and potential business partners.
The Mercantile Agency would travel the United States collecting personal accounts
of businessmen. Not only would they note their financial assets, but also
collect and asses accounts of character.

His \textit{agency} would serve as the model for commercial credit
reporting~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}.
