\section{Early Data Brokers}

\para{Credit Scores}
One of the earliest applications of data was credit. In the early 19\ts{th}
century, Francis J. Grund immigrated to the United States. Later on, he would
publish \textit{The Americans} (1837) where he describes how credit was easily
rewarded in American society based on the borrower's character and hard work.
This is in opposition to the European system of credit, where credit was
awarded to those who had collateral~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}.

Around the time that Grund was publishing his de Toquevillian analysis of
American credit, there was much debate over the equality of the system.
%many parallels here to today
Many felt that the current credit system based on character, reputation, and
ethic unfairly favored the wealthy, seen in the 1819 and 1837 financial
panics~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}. It was in the wake of these economic
downturns that the credit system went from a personal and subjective evaluation
system, to a formalized economic system.

In the beginning, letters of recommendation and consensus among neighbors of
those borrowing were collected by those lending. By the 1840's, an American
merchant that did business nationally was finding that this practice was
unsustainable. This was acutely apparent during the financial crises of the
1830's~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}. Recently bankrupted, Lewis Tappan left the
silk industry, then in 1841 founded the Mercantile Agency. His goal was the
compile detailed information about businesses and potential business partners.
The Mercantile Agency would travel the United States collecting personal accounts
of businessmen. Not only would they note their financial assets, but also
collect and asses accounts of character.

		and dislike strongly"}
\end{center}

Tappan's \textit{Mercantile Agency} would serve as the model for commercial
credit reporting and is a turning point in the American surveillance
industry~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}. The American surveillance industry,
even in its earliest form, would compile, analyze, and collect social data and
transform it into a useful piece of data.

Early forms of data collection by creditors were what we would refer to as
spying: lurking in a tavern and taking notes of who is indulging instead of at
work. This is not entirely different from ``informal data collection" by the
modern insurance company, marking your profile as risky when you post pictures
of extreme sports on a social media account~\cite{naic2012}.

Forecasting the modern data center, Tappan's \textit{Mercantile Agency}
maintained a library in its New York office. There, subscribers and customers
could request information about most known businessmen and businesswomen.
Additionally, in order to compress the data, Tappan's clerks created a form of
shorthand, creating abstract forms of data~\cite{lauer2017creditworthy}, which
is analogous to many modern storage techniques.
