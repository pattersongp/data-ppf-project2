\section{Conclusions}
Data collection and surveillance has been part of American society for
centuries. Throughout the years, the public, private corporations, and the
government has reacted to developments in the data landscape. Even at the end
of Moore's Law, computation, storage, and data services continue to become less
expensive, more entities will be able to engage with the data economy. As more
entities join the data economy, surveillance is compounded. The government's
concerns in the 1960's are not disparate from the concerns of today's, e.g.
privacy. It is the obligation of all parties to ensure data privacy, proper
storage, and protection of individuals. Without considering the implications
discussed, the information society will continue to fall victim to mass
surveillance, thus inhibit expression through a chilling of society.
