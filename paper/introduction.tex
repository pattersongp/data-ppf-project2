\section{Introduction}

The data economy has changed the companies do business. The profits of
companies dealing data-- whether it be its collection or distribution--are sky
rocketing.  Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft net over
\$25bn in net profit only in the first quarter of 2017~\cite{economist2017}.
While companies of this size have been targeted by anti-trust hawks in the past
(eg. Standard Oil), the commodity has changed from oil to data.

The world has become increasingly reliable upon data. The applications that
shape our modern experience rely on data-- lots of data. Our daily interactions
are dictated by data which describes us. Hardware was the most valuable item in
industry, which was eventually replaced by software. Now the landscape has
changed again: the next generation 's most valuable industry asset will be
data~\cite{janeway2018doing}.

As the data race continues, many problematic questions are left to be
addressed.  What do we do about non-consensual data collection? When a
technology becomes so engrained in our social fabric, what is our relationship
with the company that owns that technology?

%Employees at large technology companies are beginning to disrupt the disrupters.
%There is an ever growing concensus among engineers, product managers, and technologists
%that large technology companies need to be regulated.

It is the burden of this essay to show that the data economy is driven by the need
to categorize individuals. This need is motivated by many different industries,
advertising and credit reporting for example. Through the lense of early credit reporting,
this essay will show how data is used to fulfill this need and how this economy
was created and is sustained.
