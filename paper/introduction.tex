\section{Introduction}

In the middle of the 20\ts{th} century, Americans realized that massive private
organizations were collecting data on their daily lives, qualitatively
evaluating their trustworthiness, then using that data to shape their future.
This was as much a revelation for politicians as it was the general public.

The professionals that were collecting this data were astonished at the complete
ignorance of the public that this was going on.
%~\cite{ 212 of CreditWorthy }

The computational revolution of the 1950's exaggerated this effect. With the
high rate of advancements in computing, it was becoming increasingly easier to
not only collect data, but also store and make inferences from data. It was
during this time that statistical credit scoring was established and a
statistical model would decide whether or not you would be able to afford your
new house.

In the 21\ts{st} century, the American public and politicians are experiencing
another reckoning. As engineers have continued to fulfill Moores' Law,
computation has become increasingly less expensive. This, just like the digital
revolution of the mid 20\ts{th} century, has given rise to the systematic
surveillance of the American public.

Those companies surveilling us, just like the credit bureaus, are shaping our
daily lives, democracy, and our culture.

It is the burden of this essay to show that the revelations of the 1960's
inform the conversation surrounding our political, societal, and personal
response to the Data State % I'm making this phrase up.

% XXX How clueless are we?
% It would be great to mention the congressman asking about the iPhone to Zuckerberg.

%The data economy has changed the companies do business. The profits of
%companies dealing data-- whether it be its collection or distribution--are sky
%rocketing.  Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft net over
%\$25bn in net profit only in the first quarter of 2017~\cite{economist2017}.
%While companies of this size have been targeted by anti-trust hawks in the past
%(eg. Standard Oil), the commodity has changed from oil to data.

%The world has become increasingly reliable upon data. The applications that
%shape our modern experience rely on data-- lots of data. Our daily interactions
%are dictated by data which describes us. Hardware was the most valuable item in
%industry, which was eventually replaced by software. Now the landscape has
%changed again: the next generation 's most valuable industry asset will be
%data~\cite{janeway2018doing}.

%As the data race continues, many problematic questions are left to be
%addressed.  What do we do about non-consensual data collection? When a
%technology becomes so engrained in our social fabric, what is our relationship
%with the company that owns that technology?

%Employees at large technology companies are beginning to disrupt the disrupters.
%There is an ever growing concensus among engineers, product managers, and technologists
%that large technology companies need to be regulated.

%It is the burden of this essay to show that the data economy is driven by the need
%to categorize individuals. This need is motivated by many different industries,
%advertising and credit reporting for example. Through the lense of early credit reporting,
%this essay will show how data is used to fulfill this need and how this economy
%was created and is sustained.
